<div class="markdown">

This is a straight-to-the-point, distilled list of technical interview Do's and Don'ts, mainly for algorithmic interviews. Some of these may apply to only phone screens or whiteboard interviews, but most will apply to both. I revise this list before each of my interviews to remind myself of them and eventually internalized all of them to the point I do not have to rely on it anymore.

<tr>

<td>Familiarize yourself with the coding environment (CoderPad/CodePen). Set up the coding shortcuts, turn on autocompletion, tab spacing, etc.</td>

<td>Dress comfortably. Usually you do not need to wear smart clothes, casual should be fine. T-shirts and jeans are acceptable at most places.</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>✅</td>

<td>Stay calm and composed.</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>⚠️</td>

<td>Turn off the webcam if possible. Most remote interviews will not require video chat and leaving it on only serves as a distraction.</td>

<td>Type/write at a reasonable speed.</td>

<td>If you are cutting corners in your code, state that out loud to your interviewer and say what you would do in a non-interview setting (no time constraints). E.g., "Under non-interview settings, I would write a regex to parse this string rather than using `split()` which may not cover all cases."</td>

</tr>

<td>Practice whiteboard space-management skills.</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>⚠️</td>

<td>Reasonable defensive coding. Check for nulls, empty collections, etc. Can omit if input validity has been clarified with the interviewer.</td>

<td>Remain quiet the whole time.</td>

<td>Spend too much time writing comments.</td>

<td>Copy and paste code without checking (e.g. variables need to be renamed).</td>

</tr>

<td>❌</td>

<td>Interrupt your interviewer when they are talking. Usually if they speak, they are trying to give you hints or steer you in the right direction.</td>
